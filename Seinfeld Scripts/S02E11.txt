                             JERRY
               Men flip around the television more 
               than women, I think. Men get that remote 
               control in their hands, they don't even 
               know what the hell they're watching.
 
               
               
               You know, we just keep going, "Rerun, don't wanna watch it.. 
               " "What are you watching?" "I don't care, I gotta keep going." 
               "Who was that?" "I don't know what it
 
               
               was - doesn't matter, it's not your fault. It doesn't matter, 
               I gotta keep going." Women don't do this. See now, women will 
               stop and go, "Well, let me see what the
 
               
               show is before I change the channel." You see? Men just fly. 
               Because women, you see, women nest and men hunt. That's why we 
               watch TV differently. Before
 
               
               there was flipping around, before there was television, kings 
               and emperors and pharaohs and such had story-tellers that would 
               tell them stories 'cause that was their
 
               
               entertainment. I always wonder, in that era, if they would get, 
               like, thirty story-tellers together so they could still flip 
               around. Just go, "Alright start telling me a story,
 
               
               what's happening? I don't want to hear anymore. Shut up. Go to 
               the next guy. What are you talking about? Is there a girl in 
               that story? ..No? Shut up. Go to the next
 
               
               guy. What do you got? I don't want to hear that either. Shut 
               up. No, go ahead, what are you talking about?.. I don't want 
               to hear that. No, the all of you, get out of
 
               
               here. I'm going to bed."

               
               (Scene ends)

               
               (Coffee shop)

               
                             GEORGE
               (Shocked) She's pregnant? Leslie is 
               pregnant?! Oh, see, there is no justice.
 
               
               
                             JERRY
               She's the performance artist, right?
 
               
               
                             GEORGE
               (Sarcastic) Yeah, performance artist. 
               She's a real performer. A real trooper.
 
               
               
                             JERRY
               What's her husband's name, again? Chip? 
               Kip? Skip?
 
               
                             ELAINE
               Todd.

               
                             JERRY
               Todd. Oh yeah. (To George) He's a Kennedy.
 
               
               
                             ELAINE
               No, he's not.

               
                             JERRY
               C'mon. He's a third cousin, or something.
 
               
               
                             ELAINE
               By marriage.

               
                             JERRY
               Oh, by marriage. (To George) We went 
               to their wedding. You should have heard 
               him talking about Chappaquiddick - trying 
               to blame the whole thing on
 
               
               bad directions.

               
                             GEORGE
               That woman was unequivocally the worst 
               date of my life.
 
               
                             ELAINE
               Oh, pardon me for trying to set you 
               up with a beautiful, intelligent woman.
 
               
               
                             GEORGE
               What, you don't think I can attract 
               beautiful, intelligent women?
 
               
                             JERRY
               Thin ice, George. Thin ice..

               
                             GEORGE
               (Sarcastic) Maybe for her new performance 
               piece she'll give birth on stage.
 
               
               
                             ELAINE
               She stopped performing.

               
                             GEORGE
               (Again, sarcastic) Oh, what a huge blow 
               to the culture.
 
               
                             JERRY
               (Gesturing to George) You believe this 
               guy? He holds a grudge like Khomeini.
 
               
               
                             GEORGE
               She dragged me down to that warehouse 
               on the waterfront in Brooklin to see 
               one of her "performances".
 
               
                             JERRY
               Oh, and she cooks dinner onstage for 
               some celebrity?
 
               
                             GEORGE
               God! She's cooking dinner for God! She's 
               yelling and screaming, and the next 
               thing I know, she throws a big can of 
               chocolate syrup all over my new red
 
               
               
               shirt.

               
                             ELAINE
               It was an accident!

               
                             GEORGE
               Oh, yeah, sure, accident, right. She 
               was aiming right at me like she was 
               putting out a fire! Then, for the rest 
               of the show, I'm sitting there with 
               chocolate all
 
               
               over my shirt. Flies are landing on me. I'm boiling - I'm fantasizing 
               all the things I'm gonna say when I see her. And later, finally, 
               backstage when I talk to her, I'm a
 
               
               groveling worm. "What kind of chocolate was that? Do you throw 
               any other foods?"
 
               
                             JERRY
               (To Elaine) he thought he still had 
               a shot.
 
               
                             GEORGE
               And then, then, then she leaves with 
               somebody else! Never even, never even 
               said goodbye! Never called me back.. 
               Never apologized. Nothing. Like I
 
               
               
               was dirt.

               
                             JERRY
               What ever happened with the shirt?
 
               
               
                             GEORGE
               I still have it. The collar's okay. 
               I wear it under sweaters.
 
               
                             ELAINE
               I don't know what I'm gonna do. She 
               asked me to give her a baby shower.
 
               
               
                             JERRY
               Asked you? You're not going to do that 
               are you?
 
               
                             ELAINE
               anyone else, never. But, Leslie - I 
               have a problem saying no to. For some 
               reason, I seem to want her approval.
 
               
               
                             GEORGE
               Let Maria Shriver give her a baby shower.
 
               
               
                             JERRY
               Ask not what I can do for you - ask 
               what you can do for me.
 
               
                             GEORGE
               (Germanic) Ich bin ein sucker.

               
                             ELAINE
               Oh, would you two stop with the Kennedys? 
               Why does everybody make such a big deal 
               about he Kennedys? What is this fascination?! 
               Who cares?! It's
 
               
               all so boring..

               
                             GEORGE
               She doesn't deserve a baby shower. She 
               deserves a baby monsoon. She deserves 
               Rosemary's baby!
 
               
                             ELAINE
               (To Jerry) I do have one teeny little 
               problem, though.
 
               
                             GEORGE
               Never said goodbye. Never apologized. 
               Nothing.
 
               
                             ELAINE
               See, I was gonna give the shower in 
               my apartment..
 
               
                             JERRY
               But?

               
                             ELAINE
               My roommate has Lyme disease.

               
                             JERRY
               Lyme disease? I thought she had Epstein-Barr 
               Syndrome?
 
               
                             ELAINE
               She has this in addition to Epstein-Barr. 
               It's like Epstein-Barr with a twist 
               of Lyme disease.
 
               
                             JERRY
               How did she get Lyme disease?

               
                             ELAINE
               I don't know. She did some outdoor version 
               of Hair in Danbury, Connecticut.
 
               
                             JERRY
               They still do that play?

               
                             ELAINE
               It's a classic.

               
                             JERRY
               With all the nudity?

               
                             ELAINE
               I guess. She must've rolled over on 
               a tick during the love-in.
 
               
                             GEORGE
               (Still mad a Leslie) Never said goodbye. 
               Goodbye!
 
               
                             JERRY
               Explain to me how this baby shower thing 
               works.
 
               
                             ELAINE
               What do you wanna know?

               
                             JERRY
               Well, I mean, does it ever erupt into 
               a drunken orgy of violence?
 
               
                             ELAINE
               Rarely.

               
                             JERRY
               There's no hazing of the fetus, or anything, 
               is there?
 
               
                             ELAINE
               No.

               
                             JERRY
               When is this suppose to be?

               
                             ELAINE
               Saturday.

               
                             JERRY
               Saturday?.. Well, I have a show in Buffalo 
               on Saturday. They're not gonna bust 
               up my apartment, or anything, are they?
 
               
               
                             ELAINE
               I'll take full responsibility. You won't 
               regret it.
 
               
                             JERRY
               'Cause I've seen these pregnant women 
               - and they sometimes misjudge their 
               fetal girth. Just like one wrong turn, 
               and boom! And entire buffet is swept 
               off
 
               
               the table.

               
                             GEORGE
               Someday, before I die, mark my words 
               - I'm gonna tell that woman exactly 
               what I think of her. I'll never be able 
               to forgive myself until I do.
 
               
                             JERRY
               And if you do?

               
                             GEORGE
               I still won't be able to forgive myself 
               - but at least it won't be about this.
 
               
               
               (Scene ends)

               
               (Jerry's apartment)

               
               (Jerry's TV's not giving a clear picture. He messes with the 
               dials as Kramer looks over his shoulder)
 
               
                             KRAMER
               What are you doing this for? Look at 
               you..
 
               
                             JERRY
               Quiet. I'm trying to get a picture.
 
               
               
                             KRAMER
               But you don't have to do this! This 
               guy is waiting in my house.
 
               
                             JERRY
               (Pleading) Leave me alone.

               
                             KRAMER
               It's a one-time fee. A hundred and fifty 
               bucks. Why live like this?!
 
               
                             JERRY
               I'm not getting illegal cable!

               
                             KRAMER
               Oh, so what are you gonna do? You gonna 
               wait for the cable companies to resolve 
               their dispute? They're gonna be in court 
               for years.
 
               
                             JERRY
               No, I read in the paper..

               
                             KRAMER
               (Sarcastic) Oh, oh, the paper..

               
                             JERRY
               Well, they might hook us up again.
 
               
               
                             KRAMER
               Oh, God, you're so naive! All the cable 
               companies care about is the "Big Mammoo." 
               (Jerry wacks the TV) Oh, look at you! 
               You're banging things..
 
               
               Pathetic. Just wasting your life. I'm offering you fifty-six 
               channels - movies, sports, nudity. And it's free! For life!

               Can you hear yourself? Can, can, do 
               you know what you're saying?!
 
               
                             JERRY
               What you're suggesting is illegal.
 
               
               
                             KRAMER
               It's not illegal.

               
                             JERRY
               It's against the law.

               
                             KRAMER
               Well, yeah.

               
                             JERRY
               (Gesturing to the rabbit ears) Just, 
               just, hold this. Can you hold that?
 
               
               
                             KRAMER
               (Holding the rabbit ears) Look, will 
               you at least let me bring the guy over? 
               He's an amazing man. He's a Russian 
               immigrant. He escaped the Gulag. He's
 
               
               
               like the Sakharov of cable guys.. He'll slow down your gas meter. 
               He sells slugs, Jerry. Slugs for the subway.
 
               
                             JERRY
               A real human rights nut, huh?

               
                             KRAMER
               Yeah. He's intense, man.

               
                             JERRY
               I don't know. What if I get caught?
 
               
               
                             KRAMER
               Oh, you're not gonna get caught. Look, 
               let me get him. Man, it's the nineties, 
               it's Hammer time! Come on, just let 
               me get him.
 
               
               (Kramer drops the rabbit ears, and goes to his apartment. He 
               then returns with a Russian cable guy - Anatoly Tabachnick, and 
               his assistant. Tabachnick mumbles,
 
               
               shakes, laughs, then wanders around the apartment. Jerry looks 
               confused)

               I'm going out of town tomarrow.
 
               
                             TABACHNICK
               Tomarrow okay.

               
                             KRAMER
               No problem. Yeah, you'll have the whole 
               thing installed by the time you get 
               back.

               on the TV, sirens are gonna go off. 
               They're gonna track me down like a dog, 
               I know it..

               just said) Put it in.

               I'm not afraid of flying, although many 
               people do have fear of flying and, I 
               have no arguement with that. I think 
               fear of flying is quite rational because, 
               human
 
               
               beings cannot fly. Humans have fear of flying same way fish have 
               fear of driving. Put a fish behind the wheel, and they go, "This 
               isn't right. I shouldn't be doing this. I
 
               
               don't belong here."

               Well, so what should we do?

               
                             GEORGE
               Shouldn't we at least drop off your 
               bag?
 
               
               (Jerry's suddenly suspicious. He notices George's red collar, 
               then reaches over and pulls the sweater down)
 
               
                             JERRY
               Red shirt! Red shirt! That's the red 
               shirt!
 
               
                             GEORGE
               (Nervous) What are you talking about?
 
               
               
                             JERRY
               You're wearing the chocolate shirt!
 
               
               
                             GEORGE
               I am? What a strange coincidence..
 
               
               
                             JERRY
               A - Ha! Nice try, my friend, but you 
               gotta get up pretty early in the morning..
 
               
               
                             GEORGE
               (Pleading) You gotta let me go over 
               there.
 
               
                             JERRY
               What are you gonna do? Badger a pregnant 
               woman at her own baby shower?! What 
               are you, gonna take it off and make 
               her rinse it in club soda?
 
               
                             GEORGE
               No, I'm gonna hold it under her nose 
               so she can smell the scent of stale 
               Bosco that I had to live with for three 
               years, and I'm gonna say, "Remember 
               this
 
               
               shirt, baby?! Well, now, it's payback time!"

               We just bought an apartment on Riverside 
               Drive. Bernard Goetz's mother used to 
               live there.

               I'm having a planned C-section. My therapist 
               told me if I go through labor, I might 
               get psychotic.

               Sargent Shriver? Is he still with them? 
               You don't hear much about him these 
               days. Is he out of the loop?

               this, Sears?
 
               
               (Kramer bursts through the door, followed by Tabachnick and his 
               assistant. Tabachnick looks over a woman, and nods approvingly.

               What are you doing here?
 
               
                             KRAMER
               We're putting in cable.

               
                             ELAINE
               The cable? No, no, no. I'm having a 
               party here. You can't do this now!

                             KRAMER
               Which one?

               
                             ELAINE
               Both of the them.

               
                             KRAMER
               Oh, they're Soviet Cable guys.

               
                             ELAINE
               Okay.. Does Jerry know about this?
 
               
               
                             KRAMER

               Elaine, do you know how booked up this 
               guy is? Now, if I send him away now, 
               it's gonna take Jerry months to get 
               him back.. He won't like that.
 
               
                             ELAINE
               Alright. Just do it fast and then get 
               out.

               that kind of treatment! What,
 
               
               you don't have the common courtesy to return my calls?! To apologize! 
               You think I'm some sort of a loser, that likes to be abused and 
               ignored?! Who's shirt can be
 
               
               ruined without financial restitution?! Some sort of a masochist 
               who enjoys being humiliated? You think you can avoid me like 
               I have some sort of disease?! You have
 
               
               the disease! You have the disease! You may be beautiful and rich 
               and physically .. just .. unbelievable, but you sicken me! You 
               disgust me! You and everyone like
 
               
               you!

               (Flirting with a female guest) Yeah, 
               I eat the whole apple. The core, stem, 
               seeds, everything.

               him. (Gestures to Tabachnick) Look! 
               He's eating all the food!
 
               
                             KRAMER
               Yeah, yeah. Well, you know, there are 
               many differences between American and 
               Soviet cultures that you're not aware 
               of. See, in Russian, the cable guy,
 
               
               
               they got the whole run of the house. Yeah, that's tradition. 
               (Turns back to the woman) Did you ever eat the bark of a pineapple?

               fighting)

               shouts in Russian. A woman finally gets out. Tabachnick gets 
               into the bathroom and slams the door shut. Jerry and George enter.

               What are you doing here? I thought you 
               were out of town for the weekend.
 
               
               
                             JERRY
               The show was cancelled. There was a 
               blizzard.
 
               
                             ELAINE
               I can't believe you told Kramer it's 
               okay to put the cable in during the 
               shower! Jerry, look,, look! They've 
               eaten everything.

               Jerry, what a surprise! I thought you 
               sere out of town.
 
               
                             JERRY
               Well, Leslie, sometimes the road less 
               travelled is less travelled for a reason.

               (Speaking confidentially to George) 
               George, don't even think about it! Don't 
               even dream about it!

               Tabachnick joins his assistant at the food table. George is ready 
               for Leslie - he takes off his sweater,
 
               
               revealing the chocolate stain. He walks over to Leslie)

               Yeah?

               Hi.

               
                             GEORGE
               (Laughs) You, I guess, you don't remember 
               me.. but we actually, kind of um.. went 
               out.. a couple of years ago.. once.. 
               remember?
 
               
                             LESLIE
               Vaguely.

               
                             GEORGE
               You took me to one of your shows..
 
               
               
                             LESLIE
               And?

               
                             GEORGE
               And, um, it was quite good. In fact, 
               you even incorporated me into the show. 
               I'm not actually a performer. Although, 
               my parents felt I had talent..

               him. Jerry looks confused) Remember 
               me?

               a bell, Jerry? We had a date, three 
               years ago. You took me to one of your 
               shows.
 
               
                             JERRY
               (Stammering) Oh, I, I, think I remember..
 
               
               
                             MARY
               Told me you had a great time! Said you'd 
               call me the next day.
 
               
                             JERRY
               Well, I'm sure I meant to call.. I probably 
               just lost your..
 
               
                             MARY
               Liar! Liar! You were never going to 
               call me! You thought you could waltz 
               throught the rest of your life and never 
               bump into me again! But you were wrong,
 
               
               
               Jerry! You were wrong! What do you think, I'm some sort of poor, 
               pathetic wretch?!
 
               
                             JERRY
               No, I don't think that..

               
                             MARRY
               Some person who could be dismissed and 
               ignored?! Some insignificant piece of 
               dust?! Some person who doesn't deserve 
               your respect and your
 
               
               attention?! You're the one that doesn't deserve my respect and 
               my attention! You're the insignificant piece of dust!
 
               
               (She feigns, spitting on the floor near Jerry's shoes, and storms 
               out. Scene cuts to George. Leslie's bored to death)
 
               
                             GEORGE
               Actually, I never had any formal training. 
               I guess I'd be better suited for improvs, 
               or something..
 
               
               (Mary runs for the door, pushing Leslie into George. Her chocolate 
               cake is now all over George's shirt)
 
               
                             LESLIE
               Thanks a lot!

               
               (Scene cuts to the front door. Elaine is saying goodbye to a 
               few women who are rushing out the door)
 
               
                             ELAINE
               I'm sorry you have to go.

               
                             WOMAN
               Yeah. I really have to be going.

               
               (Scene cuts to Jerry. He notices the cable guys)

               
                             JERRY
               Alright, listen, I've changed my mind 
               about this whole thing. I don't want 
               cable.
 
               
                             KRAMER
               Don't be a fool.

               
                             TABACHNICK
               You don't want?

               
                             JERRY
               No, I don't want. So, just tell me what 
               I owe you for your trouble..
 
               
                             TABACHNICK
               (Confers with his assistant, then) Four 
               hundred dollars.
 
               
                             JERRY
               (To Kramer) Four hundred dollars?1 You 
               told me one-fifty!
 
               
               (Scene cuts to Elaine by the door. Leslie has her coat on, and 
               is ready to leave)
 
               
                             LESLIE
               I'm going.. obviously.

               
                             ELAINE
               Oh, Leslie, I am so sorry about everything 
               that went on here tonight. You know, 
               I had no idea..
 
               
                             LESLIE
               Elaine, you know, I was watching you 
               tonight, and I realized something. You're 
               just like you were in college.
 
               
                             ELAINE
               (Not sure if it was an insult or a compliment) 
               Oh, thank you. (Leslie leaves. Then 
               Elaine wonders to herself) "Like you 
               were in college"?
 
               
                             LESLIE
               (Comes back, and yells in the direction 
               of the bedroom) Come on! Let's go!
 
               
               
               (George comes out from the bedroom, carrying all the shower gifts 
               - embarrassed)
 
               
                             GEORGE
               (Sheepishly to Elaine) I'll be right 
               back. (Leaves)
 
               
                             JERRY
               (Defiantly) I'm not paying four hundred 
               dollars! I don't even want the thing. 
               What are you going to do?!
 
               
               (Scene ends)

               
               (Jerry's apartment)

               
               (Jerry's TV screen is cracked. George and Elaine are slumped 
               on chairs)
 
               
                             GEORGE
               Every woman on the face of the earth 
               has complete control of my life. And 
               yet, I want them all.. is that irony?
 
               
               
                             ELAINE
               Why can't I meet a Kennedy? ..I saw 
               John Junior once downtown. I was on 
               a bus. I hit the ding, but.. it didn't 
               stop.
 
               
                             JERRY
               Alright, I said I had a good time and 
               I'd call, but who takes that literally?
 
               
               
                             KRAMER
               (Pops his head into Jerry's apartment) 
               Hey, come on over, Dr. Zhivago's on 
               cable in five minutes.. I'm making popcorn! 
               (Leaves)
 
               
               (Scene ends)

               
               (Night club)

               
                             JERRY
               What do you do at the end of a date 
               when you know you don't want to see 
               this person ever again, for the rest 
               of your life? What do you say? What 
               do you
 
               
               say? No matter what you say, it's a lie. "I'll see you around. 
               See you around. If you're around, and I'm around, I'll see you 
               around that area. You'll be around other
 
               
               people. You won't be around me. But you will be around." "Take 
               care now." Did you ever say that to somebody? "Take care now. 
               Take care, now. Because, I'm
 
               
               not going to be taking care of you. So, you should take care, 
               now." "Take care. Take care." What does this mean? "Take off!" 
               Isn't that what you really want to say?
 
               
               "Take off now."
(Comedy club)

               
                             JERRY
               (A couple of days ago I used a public 
               phone), go over time on the call,
 
               
               
               hang up the phone, walk away. You've had this happen? Phone rings. 
               It's the
 
               
               phone company... they want more money. Don't you love this? And 
               you got them
 
               
               right where you want them for the first time in your life. You're 
               on the
 
               
               street, there's nothing they can do. I like to let it ring a 
               few times, you
 
               
               know, let her sweat a little over there, then I just pick it 
               up, "Yeah,
 
               
               operator... oh, I got the money... I got the money right here... 
               D'you hear
 
               
               that? (taps on microphone) That's a quarter. Yeah, you want that 
               don't you?"
 
               
               (Jerry, Elaine & George enter the Chinese restaurant)

               
                             ELAINE
               No, they've just got to get more cops 
               on the force, it's as simple as
 
               
               that.

               
                             GEORGE
               Cops. I don't even care about cops. 
               I wanna see more garbage men. It's
 
               
               
               much more important. All I wanna see are garbage trucks, garbage 
               cans and
 
               
               garbage men. You're never gonna stop crime, we should at least 
               be clean.
 
               
                             JERRY
               I tell you what they should do, they 
               should combine the two jobs, make
 
               
               
               it one job, 'cop\garbage man'. I always see cops walking around 
               with nothing to
 
               
               do. Grab a broom! Start sweeping. You sweep sweep sweep... catch 
               a criminal, get
 
               
               right back to sweeping.

               
                             ELAINE
               You should run for mayor.

               
                             JERRY
               Ehh, nobody listens.

               
                             ELAINE
               Where is someone? I'm starving.

               
                             GEORGE
               I think this is him right here.

               
                             ELAINE
               Is there a table ready?

               
                             RESTAURANT MANAGER
               How many?

               
                             ELAINE
               How many?

               
                             JERRY
               Is Tatiana coming?

               
                             GEORGE
               I don't know, I have to call her, tell 
               her where we are. I'm very
 
               
               lucky she's even considering seeing me at all.

               
                             JERRY
               Really? I thought things were going 
               OK.
 
               
                             GEORGE
               They were, it's kinda complicated.
 
               
               
                             JERRY
               Well what is it?

               
                             ELAINE
               How many?

               
                             JERRY
               Ah, alright, four. Seinfeld.

               
                             BRUCE
               Four. It'll be five, ten minutes.

               
                             GEORGE
               What do you wanna do?

               
                             ELAINE
               Let's go someplace else, I am too hungry.
 
               
               
                             JERRY
               We might as well just stay here, we 
               haven't got that much time if we
 
               
               wanna make it to the movie.

               
                             GEORGE
               I gotta call Tatiana. where's the phone?
 
               
               
                             JERRY
               Tatiana...

               
               (George goes over to the public phone. There's a guy using it)
 
               
               
                             GEORGE
               Excuse me, are you gonna be very long?
 
               
               
               (guy on phone just turns the other way without answering)

               
                             BRUCE
               Lashbrook(sp?), 4!

               
                             JERRY
               So did I do a terrible thing?

               
                             ELAINE
               You mean lying to your uncle?

               
                             JERRY
               I couldn't have dinner with him. 'Plan 
               9 from Outer Space', one night
 
               
               only, the big screen. My hands are tied!

               
                             GEORGE
               You know it's a public phone, you're 
               not supposed to just
 
               
               chit-chat.

               
                             ELAINE
               Jerry, get menus so when we sit down 
               we can order right away.
 
               
                             JERRY
               Can't look at a menu now, I gotta be 
               at the table.
 
               
                             GEORGE
               He knows I'm waiting. He sees me. He 
               just doesn't wanna look.
 
               
                             ELAINE
               Everything's gotta be just so with you, 
               doesn't it?
 
               
                             JERRY
               Hey, I offered you those cookies in 
               my house.
 
               
                             ELAINE
               Health cookies. I hate those little 
               dustboard fructose things.
 
               
                             GEORGE
               I just can't believe at the way people 
               are. What is it with humanity?
 
               
               What kind of a world do we live in?

               
               (Jerry stares at someone)

               
                             ELAINE
               What?

               
                             JERRY
               There's a woman over there that looks 
               really familiar. Dark hair,
 
               
               striped shirt?

               
                             ELAINE
               I've never seen her before.

               
                             JERRY
               I know this woman. This is gonna drive 
               me crazy.
 
               
               (a group of people comes in, one of them bumps into Elaine)
 
               
               
                             MAN
               Oh, Excuse me.

               
                             ELAINE
               I'm sorry.

               
               (the group just walks right into the dining room)

               
                             ELAINE
               Didja see that? Those people, look, 
               they're getting a table.
 
               
                             JERRY
               Well maybe they were here from before.
 
               
               
                             ELAINE
               No no no, they weren't here before.
 
               
               
                             GEORGE
               Excuse me, are you going to be much 
               longer? I have to make a
 
               
               very important call.

               
               (guy on phone turns away again)

               
                             ELAINE
               Find out what's going on!

               
                             JERRY
               Excuse me, didn't those people just 
               come in? I believe we were ahead of
 
               
               
               them.

               
                             ELAINE
               Yeah.

               
                             BRUCE
               What's your name?

               
                             JERRY
               Seinfeld.

               
               (Bruce starts talking to a Chinese woman in Chinese)

               
                             BRUCE
               No, no, they were here before. Keckitch(sp?), 
               2!
 
               
                             ELAINE
               Did you ever notice how happy people 
               are when they finally get a table?
 
               
               
               They think they're so special because they've been chosen. It's 
               enough to make
 
               
               you sick.

               
                             JERRY
               Boy, you are really hungry.

               
                             GEORGE
               Hey!

               
               (guy on phone smiles at him and turns back. George, annoyed, 
               goes over to Jerry)
 
               
                             GEORGE
               If anything happens here, can I count 
               on you?
 
               
                             JERRY
               What?

               
                             GEORGE
               If we decide to go at it.

               
                             JERRY
               Yeah, I wanna get into a rumble...
 
               
               
                             GEORGE
               I have to get in touch with Tatiana! 
               And look at his little outfit.
 
               
               It's all so coordinated, the way his socks matching to his shirt. 
               I really hate
 
               
               this guy.

               
                             ELAINE
               I'm gonna faint...

               
                             JERRY
               George, who is that woman in the stripes?
 
               
               
                             GEORGE
               I don't know her.

               
                             JERRY
               She looks so familiar.

               
                             ELAINE
               Ya know, its not fair people are seated 
               First Come First Served, It
 
               
               should be based on who's hungriest. I feel like just going over 
               there and
 
               
               taking some food off somebody's plate.

               
                             JERRY
               I'll tell you what, there's 50 bucks 
               in it for you if you do it.
 
               
                             ELAINE
               What do you mean?

               
                             JERRY
               You walk over that table, you pick up 
               an eggroll, you don't say
 
               
               anything, you eat it, say 'thank you very much', wipe your mouth, 
               walk away- I
 
               
               give you 50 bucks.

               
                             GEORGE
               What are they gonna do?

               
                             JERRY
               They won't do anything; in fact, you'll 
               be giving them a story to tell
 
               
               for the rest of their lives.

               
                             ELAINE
               50 bucks, you'll give me 50 bucks?
 
               
               
                             JERRY
               50 bucks. That table over there, the 
               three couples.
 
               
                             ELAINE
               OK, I don't wanna go over there and 
               do it, and then come back here and
 
               
               
               find out there was some little loophole, like I didn't put mustard 
               on it or
 
               
               something...

               
                             JERRY
               No, no tricks.

               
                             ELAINE
               Should I do it, George?

               
                             GEORGE
               For 50 bucks? I'd put my face in the 
               soup and blow.
 
               
                             ELAINE
               Alright, alright. Here, hold this. I'm 
               doin' it.
 
               
               (Elaine goes over to the table, smiling)

               
                             ELAINE
               I know this sounds crazy, but the two 
               men who are
 
               
               standing behind me are going to give me 50 bucks if I stand here 
               and eat one of
 
               
               your eggrolls.

               
               (the people at the table are confused)

               
                             ELAINE
               I'll give you 25 if you let me do it.
 
               
               
                             PEOPLE AT TABLE
               What? What is she talking about? What 
               did she say?
 
               
               (Elaine runs from the table, laughing)

               
                             JERRY
               What happened?

               
                             ELAINE
               Did you see that?

               
                             GEORGE
               What were you doing?

               
                             ELAINE
               I offered them 25, they had no idea...
 
               
               
                             JERRY
               George, the phone's free.

               
                             GEORGE
               Alleluia.

               
               (as George reaches for the phone, a woman snatches it and starts 
               dialing)
 
               
                             GEORGE
               Excuse me, I was waiting here.

               
                             WOMAN AT PHONE
               Where? I didn't see you.

               
                             GEORGE
               I've been standing here for the last 
               ten minutes!
 
               
                             WOMAN
               Well I won't be long.

               
                             GEORGE
               That's not the point. The point is I 
               was here first.
 
               
                             WOMAN
               Well if you were here first, you'd be 
               holding the phone.
 
               
                             GEORGE
               You know, we're living in a society! 
               We're supposed
 
               
               to act in a civilized way.

               
               (he goes over to Jerry and Elaine)

               
                             GEORGE
               Does she care? No. Does anyone ever 
               display the slightest sensitivity
 
               
               
               over the problems of a fellow individual? No. No. A resounding 
               no!
 
               
               (guy on phone approaches George)

               
                             GUY
               Hey, sorry I took so long.

               
                             GEORGE
               Oh that's OK, really, don't worry about 
               it.
 
               
                             ELAINE
               How do people fast? Did Ghandi get this 
               crazy? I'm gonna walk around,
 
               
               see what dishes look good.

               
                             JERRY
               I told my uncle I had a stomach ache 
               tonight. You think he bought that?
 
               
               
                             GEORGE
               Yeah, well, he probably bought it.
 
               
               
                             JERRY
               So what happened with Tatiana?

               
                             GEORGE
               I shouldn't even tell you this.

               
                             JERRY
               Come on...

               
                             GEORGE
               Well, after dinner last week, she invites 
               me back to her apartment.
 
               
                             JERRY
               I'm with you.

               
                             GEORGE
               Well, it's this little place with this 
               little bathroom. It's like
 
               
               right there, you know, it's not even down a little hall or off 
               in an alcove.
 
               
               You understand? There's no... buffer zone. So, we start to fool 
               around, and
 
               
               it's the first time, and it's early in the going. And I begin 
               to perceive this
 
               
               impending... intestinal requirement, whose needs are going to 
               surpass by great
 
               
               lengths anything in the sexual realm. So I know I'm gonna have 
               to stop. And as
 
               
               this is happening I'm thinking, even if I can somehow manage 
               to momentarily...
 
               
               extricate myself from the proceedings and relieve this unstoppable 
               force, I know
 
               
               that that bathroom is not gonna provide me with the privacy that 
               I know I'm
 
               
               going to need...

               
                             JERRY
               This could only happen to you.

               
                             GEORGE
               So I finally stop and say, "Tatiana, 
               I hope you don't take this the
 
               
               wrong way, but I think it would be best if I left".

               
                             JERRY
               You said this to her after.

               
                             GEORGE
               No. During.

               
                             JERRY
               Oh, boy.

               
                             GEORGE
               Yeah.

               
                             JERRY
               Wow! So...?

               
                             GEORGE
               So I'm dressing and she's staring up 
               at me, struggling to compute this
 
               
               
               unprecedented turn of events. I don't know what to say to reassure 
               this woman,
 
               
               and worst of all, I don't have the time to say it. The only excuse 
               she might
 
               
               possibly have accepted is if I told her I am in reality Batman, 
               and I'm very
 
               
               sorry, I just saw the Bat-Signal. It took me 3 days of phone 
               calls to get her
 
               
               to agree to see me again. Now she's waiting for me to call her, 
               and she's
 
               
               (gestures towards woman on phone) still on the phone.

               
               (Elaine comes over)

               
                             ELAINE
               I hate this place. I don't know why 
               we came here, I'm never coming back
 
               
               
               here again.

               
                             JERRY
               Who is that woman?!

               
                             ELAINE
               Remember when you first went out to 
               eat with your parents? Remember,
 
               
               it was such a treat to go and they serve you this different food 
               that you never
 
               
               saw before, and they put it in front of you, and it is such a 
               delicious and
 
               
               exciting adventure? And now I just feel like a big sweaty hog 
               waiting for them
 
               
               to fill up the trough.

               
                             GEORGE
               She's off. (goes over to the now available 
               public phone)
 
               
                             ELAINE
               Jerry, talk to that guy again.

               
                             JERRY
               What am I gonna say?

               
                             ELAINE
               Tell him we wanna catch a movie and 
               that we're late.
 
               
               (as Jerry approaches Bruce, a man walks in)

               
                             MR. COHEN
               Hey, what stinks in here?

               
                             BRUCE
               Mr. Cohen! Haven't seen you for a couple 
               of weeks.
 
               
                             MR. COHEN
               Well, I've been looking for a better 
               place.
 
               
               (Bruce laughs)

               
                             BRUCE
               Better place... Want a table?

               
                             MR. COHEN
               No, just bring me a plate and I'll eat 
               here.
 
               
                             BRUCE
               Give him a plate and you eat here... 
               Come on, I give you a
 
               
               table.

               
                             JERRY
               Excuse me... we've been waiting here. 
               Now, I KNOW we were ahead of that
 
               
               
               guy, he just came in.

               
                             BRUCE
               Oh no, Mr. Cohen always here.

               
                             ELAINE
               He's always here? What does that mean? 
               What does that mean?
 
               
                             BRUCE
               Oh, Mr. Cohen, very nice man. He live 
               on Park Avenue.
 
               
                             ELAINE
               Where am I? Is this a dream? What in 
               God's name is going on here?!
 
               
                             GEORGE
               She's not there. She left. She must've 
               waited and left because those
 
               
               people wouldn't get off the phone.

               
                             JERRY
               Didja leave a message?

               
                             GEORGE
               Yeah, I told her to call me here and 
               to tell anyone who answers the
 
               
               phone to ask for a balding, stocky man with glasses. I better 
               tell him I'm
 
               
               expecting a call.

               
                             ELAINE
               Oh, Jerry, here comes that woman...
 
               
               
                             JERRY
               Where do I know her?

               
               (woman in stripes approaches Jerry)

               
                             LORRAINE
               Hello, Jerry!

               
                             JERRY
               Heeeeyyyy... How you doin'?

               
                             LORRAINE
               How is everything?

               
                             JERRY
               Good, good, good... What's goin' on?
 
               
               
                             LORRAINE
               Oh, working hard. And you?

               
                             JERRY
               Oh, you know, working around, same stuff, 
               doing... whatever.
 
               
                             LORRAINE
               You haven't been around in a while.
 
               
               
                             JERRY
               I know, I know... Well, you know.

               
                             LORRAINE
               You should come by.

               
                             JERRY
               Definitely. I plan to, I'm not just 
               saying that.
 
               
                             ELAINE
               Hi, I'm Elaine.

               
                             LORRAINE
               Lorraine. Catalano.

               
                             JERRY
               I'm sorry, Lorraine, this is Elaine...
 
               
               
               (They all laugh, then silent)

               
                             LORRAINE
               Well it was nice seeing you, Jerry. 
               And nice meeting you. (she
 
               
               leaves)

               
                             ELAINE
               Oh, nice to meet you too, Lorraine!
 
               
               
                             JERRY
               Oh my god, Lorraine... that's Lorraine 
               from my uncle's office. I'm in
 
               
               big, big trouble.

               
                             ELAINE
               The one you broke the plans with tonight?
 
               
               
                             JERRY
               Yeah, she works in his office. Now she's 
               gonna see him tomorrow and
 
               
               tell him she saw me here tonight. He's gonna tell his wife, his 
               wife's gonna
 
               
               call my mother. Oh, this is bad, you don't know, the chain reaction 
               of calls
 
               
               this is gonna set off. New York, Long Island, Florida, it's like 
               the Bermuda
 
               
               Triangle. Unfortunately, nobody ever disappears. My uncle to 
               my aunt, my aunt
 
               
               to my mother, my mother to my uncle...

               
                             JERRY
               ...My uncle to my cousin, my cousin 
               to my sister, my sister to me.
 
               
                             ELAINE
               You should've just had dinner with your 
               uncle tonight and gotten in
 
               
               over with. It's just a movie.

               
                             JERRY
               Just a movie?! You don't understand. 
               This isn't 'Plans 1 through 8
 
               
               from Outer Space', this is 'Plan 9', this is the one that worked. 
               The worst
 
               
               movie ever made!

               
               (Elaine nods)

               
                             JERRY
               Hey, I got news for you, if we're making 
               this movie, we gotta get a
 
               
               table immediately.

               
                             ELAINE
               Alright, OK. Let's stop fooling around. 
               Let's just slip him some
 
               
               money.

               
                             JERRY
               In a Chinese restaurant? Do they take 
               money?
 
               
                             ELAINE
               Do they take money? Everyone takes money. 
               I used to go out with a guy
 
               
               who did it all the time, you just slip him 20 bucks.

               
                             GEORGE
               20 bucks? Isn't that excessive?

               
                             ELAINE
               Well what do you want to give him, change?
 
               
               
                             GEORGE
               It's more than the meal!

               
                             JERRY
               Oh, come on, We'll divide it up three 
               ways.
 
               
                             GEORGE
               Alright. 7,7, (points at himself) 6. 
               I'm not gonna eat that much!
 
               
                             JERRY
               I'm counting your shrimps. OK, Who's 
               gonna do it?
 
               
                             GEORGE
               Oh no, I can't do it. I-I'm not good 
               at these things, I get flustered.
 
               
               
               Once I tried to bribe an usher at the roller derby, I almost 
               got arrested.
 
               
                             ELAINE
               I guess it's you, Jer.

               
                             JERRY
               Me? What about you?

               
                             ELAINE
               Oh, I can't do that, it's a guy thing.
 
               
               
                             JERRY
               The woman's movement just can't seem 
               to make any progress in the world
 
               
               
               of bribery, can they?

               
                             ELAINE
               Give me the money.

               
               (Elaine stands close to Bruce, trying to get his attention)
 
               
               
                             ELAINE
               How's it going'?

               
                             BRUCE
               Very busy.

               
               (Elaine holds the money in front of Bruce)

               
                             ELAINE
               Boy, we are REALLY anxious to sit down.
 
               
               
                             BRUCE
               Very good specials tonight.

               
               (Elaine puts the bill on the open reservations book)

               
                             ELAINE
               If there's anything you can do to get 
               us a table we'd really appreciate
 
               
               
               it.

               
                             BRUCE
               What is your name? (he turns the page 
               over the money)
 
               
                             ELAINE
               No no, I want to eat now! (she gets 
               the money from under the page)
 
               
                             BRUCE
               Yes, we have sea-bass dinner tonight, 
               very fresh.
 
               
                             ELAINE
               Here, take this. I'm starving. Take 
               it! Take
 
               
               it!

               
               (Bruce shrugs and takes it)

               
                             BRUCE
               Dennison, 4! (goes over to 4 ladies) 
               Your table is ready.
 
               
                             ELAINE
               No no, no, I want that table. I want 
               that table! Oh, come on, did you
 
               
               see that? What was that? He took the money, he didn't give us 
               a table.
 
               
                             JERRY
               You lost the 20.

               
                             ELAINE
               Well, how could he do that?

               
                             GEORGE
               You didn't make it clear.

               
                             ELAINE
               Make it clear?

               
                             JERRY
               What a sorry exhibition that was. Alright, 
               let me get the money back.
 
               
               (goes over to Bruce) Excuse me. I realize, this is extremely 
               embarrassing, my
 
               
               friend here apparently made a mistake.

               
                             BRUCE
               Your name?

               
                             JERRY
               Seinfeld.

               
                             BRUCE
               Yeah, Seinfeld 4!

               
                             JERRY
               No no no, you see the girl there, with 
               the long hair?
 
               
               (Elaine waves at him, smiling)

               
                             BRUCE
               Oh yes, yes. Very beautiful girl, very 
               beautiful. Is your girlfriend?
 
               
                             JERRY
               Well, actually, we did date for a while, 
               but... it's really not relevant
 
               
               here.

               
                             BRUCE
               Relationships are difficult. It's very 
               hard to stay together-
 
               
                             JERRY
               Alright, listen, alright. How much longer 
               is it gonna be?
 
               
                             BRUCE
               Oh. In about five, ten minutes.

               
               (Jerry goes over to Elaine and George)

               
                             GEORGE
               So?

               
                             JERRY
               There seems to be a bit of a discrepancy.
 
               
               
                             ELAINE
               So when are we gonna eat?

               
                             JERRY
               Five, ten minutes.

               
                             GEORGE
               We should have left earlier. I told 
               you.
 
               
                             JERRY
               I don't see any way we can eat and make 
               this movie.
 
               
                             ELAINE
               Oh, well I have to eat.

               
                             JERRY
               Well let's just order to go, we'll eat 
               it in the cab.
 
               
                             ELAINE
               Eat it in the cab? Chinese food in a 
               cab?
 
               
                             JERRY
               We'll eat it in the movie.

               
                             ELAINE
               Oh, who do you think you're going? Do 
               you think that they have big
 
               
               picnic tables there?

               
                             JERRY
               Well what do you suggest?

               
                             ELAINE
               I say we leave now, we go to 'Skyburger' 
               and we scarf 'em down.
 
               
                             JERRY
               I'm not going to 'Skyburger'. Besides, 
               it's in the opposite direction,
 
               
               let's just eat popcorn or something.

               
                             BRUCE
               Cartwright?

               
                             ELAINE
               I can't have popcorn for dinner!

               
                             BRUCE
               Cartwright?

               
                             ELAINE
               I have to eat!

               
                             JERRY
               So they have hotdogs there.

               
                             ELAINE
               Oh, movie hotdogs! I rather lick the 
               food off the floor.
 
               
                             GEORGE
               I can't go anywhere, I have to wait 
               here for Tatiana's call. Let me
 
               
               just check.

               
               (goes over to Bruce)

               
                             GEORGE
               Excuse me, I'm expecting a call. Costanza?
 
               
               
                             BRUCE
               Yeah, I just got a call. I yell 'Cartwright! 
               Cartwright!', just like
 
               
               that. Nobody came up, I hang up.

               
                             GEORGE
               Well, was it for Costanza or...

               
                             BRUCE
               Yes, yes, that's it. Nobody answered.
 
               
               
                             GEORGE
               Well was it a woman?

               
                             BRUCE
               Yeah, yeah. I tell her you not here, 
               she said curse word, I hang up.
 
               
               (George comes over to Jerry and Elaine, stunned)

               
                             GEORGE
               She called. He yelled Cartwright. I 
               missed her.
 
               
                             JERRY
               Who's Cartwright?

               
                             GEORGE
               I'm Cartwright!

               
                             JERRY
               You're not Cartwri-

               
                             GEORGE
               Of course I'm not Cartwright! Look, 
               why don't you two just go to the
 
               
               movies all by yourselves, I'm not in the mood.

               
                             ELAINE
               Well me neither, I'm goin' to 'Skyburger'.
 
               
               
                             JERRY
               So You're not going?

               
                             ELAINE
               You don't need us.

               
                             JERRY
               Well I can't go to a bad movie by myself. 
               Who am I gonna make sarcastic
 
               
               remarks to, strangers? Eh, I guess I'll just go to my uncle's.
 
               
               
                             GEORGE
               Should we tell him we're leaving?

               
                             ELAINE
               What for? Let's just get out of here.
 
               
               
               (they all leave)

               
                             BRUCE
               Seinfeld, 4?

               
               (closing monologue)

               
                             JERRY
               Hunger will make people do amazing things. 
               I mean, the proof of that is               
               cannibalism. Cannibalism, what do they say, I mean, they're eating 
               and, you               
               know, "This is good, who is this? I like this person". You know, 
               I mean, I               
               would think the hardest thing about being a cannibal is trying 
               to get some very               
               deep sleep, you know what I mean? I would think, you'd be like, 
               (pretending to               
               wake up) "Who is that? Who's there? Who's there? Is somebody 
               there? What do               
               you want? What do you want? You look hungry, are you hungry? 
               Get out of here!"
